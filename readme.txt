This plugin creates a full screen ad with an expiration date without cloaking.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a full screen ad with an expiration date without cloaking. All you have to do is add a link, image and expiration and you can have a full screen ad with a cookie.

There are plugins out there that create separate full page ads or landing pages versus what Google sees. So the plugin would show the user one page while showing another page to a search engine. This can be called cloaking which is never really a good strategy to show ads or landing pages.
